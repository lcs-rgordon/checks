Write a program that does the following:
- Uses a do-while loop to repeatedly ask user for a positive number until a valid number is entered.
- Uses a for loop to recite the multiplication table from 0 to 12 times the number entered
(see example below).
- Uses a do-while loop to repeatedly ask user for a positive number until a valid number is entered.
- Uses a while loop to count from 0 to the number entered.

Sample output:

Which multiplication table should I recite? Enter a positive number: 0
Which multiplication table should I recite? Enter a positive number: 3
3 x 0 = 0
3 x 1 = 3
3 x 2 = 6
3 x 3 = 9
3 x 4 = 12
3 x 5 = 15
3 x 6 = 18
3 x 7 = 21
3 x 8 = 24
3 x 9 = 27
3 x 10 = 30
3 x 11 = 33
3 x 12 = 36
How high should I count from 0? Enter a positive number: -2
