Setup:
Create a program called multiples.c

Assignment:

Ask the user to enter a number and a divisor. Then print out multiples less than or equal to that number.
If the divisor doesn't evenly divide the number, print the error "The divisor doesn't divide the number
evenly. Exiting.", and then exit (i.e. don't do anything else).

Sample output:

Please enter a number to divide: 24
Please enter a number to divide by: 5
The divisor doesn't divide the number evenly. Exiting.

Please enter a number to divide: 24
Please enter a number to divide by: 4
All multiples of 4 <= 24 are:
24
20
16
12
8
4
0
